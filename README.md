## ‚ÑπÔ∏è How to use WLRI English Patch
1. Download [**WLRI English Patch**](https://github.com/hqddr15/WLRI-English-Patch/releases) installer from releases.
2. Make sure to update your game first to an actual version.
3. Close all the game clients.
4. Run this **WLRI English Patch** installer to update game files.

## üìù Notes
- You don't have to re-download **WLRI English Patch** installer again every week. Just download once and use it to update the game translations indefinitely.
- Almost every week on Thursday 9:30 AM (GMT+8) the game gets small updates which will overwrite text in data files back to Chinese.
- You should wait for translated files to be manually edited and pushed in this git. It usually happens a few hours later on the same day.

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Download
While manual installation is not recommended due to the inconvenieces, you can still do so if you encounter problems running the patcher. To manually download the files, click the green Code button, and select Download ZIP. After downloading, extract and place the files into their respective directories as follows:
1. The contents of the **root** folder should be placed in your **main game directory**.
2. The contents of the **data** folder should be placed inside your game's **data** directory.
3. The file **ui.zip** should be extracted directly into the **main game directory**.
